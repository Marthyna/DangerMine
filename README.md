# DangerMine
First person game, where the player has two tools: a gun and a pickaxe. With the gun the player aims and shoots the enemies that come in their direction, and with the pickaxe they mine rocks through the scenario. The player starts the game with 3 lives and zero points. For each rock mined, they earn one point, and for each enemy that touches them, they lose one life. The game ends when the player loses all lives or when all enemies are defeated.
